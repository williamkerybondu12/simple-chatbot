# simple-chatbot
A simple rule-based chatbot built using Python that can respond to basic user queries. This project demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) concepts can be applied at a beginner level without using advanced machine-learning models. The chatbot uses predefined patterns and responses to have a basic conversation with users.
